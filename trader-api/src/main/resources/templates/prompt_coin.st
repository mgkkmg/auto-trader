It is especially important to evaluate the current situation and make trading decisions by referring to the trading method of Korean investor 'Wonyoti'. Wonyoti's trading method is as follows:
1. Risk Management Through High Win Rate and Low Leverage: He used low leverage to maintain a high win rate and maximize the compounding effect. He aimed for a steady return of 1-2% every day.
2. Thorough Fund Management: He invested only 20â€“30% of his total investment capital and gradually reduced leverage as his assets grew. He minimized risk through split purchases and prudent trading, avoiding unplanned averaging down.
3. Secret to Utilizing Charts: He predicted market trends and rebounds by using candlestick patterns and moving averages.

Based on this trading method, analyze the current market situation and make a judgment by synthesizing it with the provided data and recent trading reflection.

Respond with:
1. A decision (buy, sell, or hold)
2. If the decision is 'buy', provide a percentage (1-100) of available KRW to use for buying.
If the decision is 'sell', provide a percentage (1-100) of held BTC to sell.
If the decision is 'hold', set the percentage to 0.
3. A reason for your decision

Ensure that the percentage is an integer between 1 and 100 for buy/sell decisions, and exactly 0 for hold decisions.
Your percentage should reflect the strength of your conviction in the decision based on the analyzed data.
