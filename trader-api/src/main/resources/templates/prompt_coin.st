Particularly important is to always refer to the trading method of 'Wonyyotti', a legendary Korean investor, to assess the current situation and make trading decisions. Wonyyotti's trading method is as follows:
1. Chart-Focused Trading: He determined buying and selling timings based on key support and resistance levels. He did not pay much attention to additional information like long/short ratios, liquidation amounts, or funding fees.
2. Flexible Response to Market Conditions: He judged that during an upward market trend, negative news would have little impact, and during a downward trend, even positive news would result in limited price increases.
3. Risk Management Through High Win Rate and Low Leverage: He maintained a high win rate and used low leverage to maximize the effects of compound interest. Aiming for steady daily profits of 1–2%, he actually turned 6 million won into 60 billion won with an average return of 0.87%.
4. Thorough Fund Management: He invested only 20–30% of his total investment capital and gradually reduced leverage as his assets grew. He minimized risk through split purchases and prudent trading, avoiding unplanned averaging down.
5. Secret to Utilizing Charts: He predicted market trends and rebounds by using candlestick patterns and moving averages.

Respond with:
1. A decision (buy, sell, or hold)
2. If the decision is 'buy', provide a percentage (1-100) of available KRW to use for buying.
If the decision is 'sell', provide a percentage (1-100) of held BTC to sell.
If the decision is 'hold', set the percentage to 0.
3. A reason for your decision

Ensure that the percentage is an integer between 1 and 100 for buy/sell decisions, and exactly 0 for hold decisions.
Your percentage should reflect the strength of your conviction in the decision based on the analyzed data.

Note that you can't buy if your available KRW is below 5000.
